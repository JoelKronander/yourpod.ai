# YourPod ai
YourPod ai is a demo web application using streamlit that enables users to create custom podcasts on any topic.
Using OpenAI GPT4, OpenAI TTS, or ElevenLabs Voice Cloning, YourPod ai generates a podcast transcript and audio file based on a user-provided topic.
The user can also upload an audio file to clone the voice of the speaker. The podcast can then be downloaded.
